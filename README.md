# shelfQuest
### Discover stories one quest at a time.

## About the Project

ShelfQuest is a web application built as part of a web development course assignment. It allows users to search for books and discover interesting titles using the Google Books API. Users can explore book information (title, author, cover, etc.), create a “shelf” of selected books, and embark on “quests” to discover new reading adventures.

## Motivation

To apply web development skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) in a real-world context.

To learn how to integrate an external API (Google Books API) and handle data retrieval, processing, and display.

## Features

* Search for books by keyword (title, author, ISBN) via Google Books API.

* Display book details (cover image, description, authors, published date, etc.).

* Add books to your personal “shelf”.

* A “quest” mode / theme (optional or conceptual) where the user is encouraged to explore new genres, authors or themes.

* Responsive design (works on desktop and mobile).
